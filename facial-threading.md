faqs:
  - question: "What is facial threading?"
    answer: "Facial threading is an ancient hair removal technique that uses twisted cotton thread to remove unwanted facial hair from the follicle. It's precise, gentle, and perfect for removing hair from the upper lip, chin, forehead, cheeks, and jawline."

  - question: "Is facial threading better than waxing?"
    answer: "Threading is often better for facial hair because it doesn't pull or irritate the skin like wax can. It's ideal for sensitive skin, doesn't use chemicals, and provides more precise control for shaping. Plus, there's no risk of burns or allergic reactions to wax."

  - question: "Does facial threading hurt?"
    answer: "Most clients describe it as a slight pinching sensation that's very tolerable. It's generally less painful than waxing because it doesn't pull on the skin—only the hair. The discomfort is minimal and brief, and most clients find it very manageable."

  - question: "How long does facial threading last?"
    answer: "Results typically last 3-6 weeks, depending on your hair growth cycle. Since threading removes hair from the root, it lasts much longer than shaving. Regular threading can also lead to finer, sparser regrowth over time."

  - question: "What areas can be threaded on the face?"
    answer: "We can thread any facial area including eyebrows, upper lip, chin, cheeks, forehead, sideburns, jawline, and even peach fuzz. Full face threading provides smooth, hair-free skin and creates a flawless canvas for makeup."

  - question: "Can I get facial threading if I have sensitive skin?"
    answer: "Absolutely! Threading is one of the best options for sensitive skin because it doesn't use chemicals, wax, or harsh products. It only touches the hair, not your skin, making it ideal for those with rosacea, eczema, or easily irritated skin."
