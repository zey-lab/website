faqs:
  - question: "What is a Brazilian wax?"
    answer: "A Brazilian wax removes all or most hair from the pubic area, including the front, back, and everything in between. You can choose to leave a small strip or triangle, or go completely bare—it's your preference!"

  - question: "How long does a Brazilian wax last?"
    answer: "Typically 3-6 weeks, depending on your hair growth cycle. Regular waxing can lead to sparser regrowth over time, making future appointments quicker and more comfortable."

  - question: "Does Brazilian waxing hurt?"
    answer: "There is some discomfort, especially for first-timers, but most clients find it very manageable. I use high-quality wax and gentle techniques to minimize pain. Many clients say it gets easier with each visit as your skin adjusts and hair grows back finer."

  - question: "How should I prepare for my Brazilian wax?"
    answer: "Hair should be about 1/4 inch long (2-3 weeks of growth). Exfoliate the area 24 hours before your appointment. Avoid caffeine and alcohol on the day of your appointment, as they can increase sensitivity. Wear comfortable, loose clothing."

  - question: "What should I expect during my first Brazilian wax?"
    answer: "I'll explain the process, ensure you're comfortable, and work efficiently to minimize discomfort. The appointment takes 30-45 minutes for first-timers. I maintain a professional, judgment-free environment where your comfort is the top priority."

  - question: "Where in Dallas are you located?"
    answer: "We're at 3611 Greenville Avenue, Dallas, TX 75206, serving Highland Park, East Dallas, and surrounding areas. Convenient parking and easy access from anywhere in Dallas."
