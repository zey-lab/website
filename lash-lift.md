faqs:
  - question: "What is a lash lift?"
    answer: "A lash lift is a semi-permanent treatment that lifts and curls your natural lashes from the root, creating a wide-eyed, lifted appearance. Think of it as a perm for your lashes that lasts 6-8 weeks, eliminating the need for daily lash curlers or extensions."

  - question: "How long does a lash lift last?"
    answer: "A lash lift typically lasts 6-8 weeks, following your natural lash growth cycle. As new lashes grow in, the lift gradually fades naturally. Most clients return every 6-8 weeks to maintain their lifted lashes."

  - question: "Is a lash lift better than eyelash extensions?"
    answer: "It depends on your goals! Lash lifts are lower maintenance, work with your natural lashes, require no upkeep, and are more affordable. Extensions add length and volume but require fills every 2-3 weeks and careful maintenance. Lifts are perfect if you want a natural, effortless look."

  - question: "Can I wear mascara after a lash lift?"
    answer: "Yes! After the first 24 hours, you can wear mascara. However, most clients find they don't need it—the lift creates such beautiful, defined lashes. If you do wear mascara, use a water-based formula and avoid waterproof mascara."

  - question: "Does a lash lift damage your lashes?"
    answer: "No! When performed by a trained professional using quality products, lash lifts are safe and don't damage your lashes. We use nourishing solutions and conditioning treatments to keep your lashes healthy and strong."

  - question: "What's the difference between a lash lift and a lash perm?"
    answer: "They're essentially the same thing! 'Lash lift' is the modern term for what used to be called a 'lash perm.' Today's lash lift solutions are more advanced, gentler on lashes, and create more natural-looking results than old-school perms."

## Best Lash Lift in Dallas

Welcome to **Zey Brow & Wax**, Dallas's destination for expert **lash lift** treatments. As a **Licensed Master Esthetician** with specialized training in lash enhancement, I help clients achieve naturally beautiful, lifted lashes that last 6-8 weeks. Serving Highland Park, East Dallas, and the greater Dallas area with professional lash services.

### What is a Lash Lift?

A **lash lift** is a revolutionary beauty treatment that:

- **Lifts** your natural lashes from the root
- **Curls** lashes upward for an eye-opening effect
- **Enhances** your natural lash length and shape
- **Eliminates** the need for daily lash curling
- **Creates** a wide-eyed, awake appearance

Unlike lash extensions that add synthetic lashes, a lash lift works with your own natural lashes to enhance what you already have.

### Benefits of a Lash Lift

- **No lash curler needed**: Permanent curl for 6-8 weeks
- **Waterproof**: Swim, shower, cry—your lashes stay lifted

### The Lash Lift Process

#### Step 1: Consultation (5 minutes)
We discuss your desired lash look and assess your natural lashes. I'll explain the process and answer questions.

#### Step 2: Preparation (10 minutes)
Your lower lashes are protected and your upper lashes are carefully cleaned to ensure optimal results.

#### Step 3: Lifting Application (45 minutes)
Professional solutions are applied in stages:
- **Lifting solution**: Gently lifts and curls lashes
- **Setting solution**: Locks in the beautiful curl
- **Nourishing treatment**: Conditions and strengthens lashes

You simply relax with your eyes closed while I work!

#### Step 4: Tinting (Optional)
Add **lash tinting** to darken and define your lashes for even more dramatic results.
