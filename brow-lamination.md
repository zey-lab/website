faqs:
  - question: "What is brow lamination?"
    answer: "Brow lamination is a semi-permanent treatment that restructures brow hairs to keep them in a desired shape. It creates fuller, fluffier brows by lifting and setting the hairs in place, giving you that coveted feathery brow look that lasts 6-8 weeks."

  - question: "How long does brow lamination last?"
    answer: "Brow lamination typically lasts 6-8 weeks. The results gradually fade as your natural brow hair growth cycle continues. For best results, we recommend rebooking every 6-8 weeks."

  - question: "Is brow lamination good for thin brows?"
    answer: "Absolutely! Brow lamination is perfect for thin or sparse brows. It makes existing hairs appear fuller and fluffier by lifting them upward and setting them in place, creating the illusion of thicker, fuller brows without makeup."

  - question: "Can I get brow lamination if I have very thick brows?"
    answer: "Yes! Brow lamination works beautifully on thick, unruly brows. It tames and smooths stubborn hairs, keeping them in your desired shape. It's perfect for controlling thick brows that tend to grow in different directions."

  - question: "What's the difference between brow lamination and microblading?"
    answer: "Brow lamination works with your existing hairs to create fuller-looking brows and lasts 6-8 weeks. Microblading is a semi-permanent tattoo technique that creates hair-like strokes in the skin and lasts 1-3 years. Lamination is non-invasive, painless, and requires no downtime."

  - question: "How should I care for my brows after lamination?"
    answer: "Keep brows dry for 24 hours after treatment. Avoid steam, saunas, and swimming for 48 hours. Brush them daily with a spoolie and apply nourishing brow oil. Avoid oil-based products directly on brows as they can break down the lamination."

## Best Brow Lamination in Dallas

Welcome to **Zey Brow & Wax**, your destination for expert **brow lamination** in Dallas. As a **Licensed Master Esthetician** specializing in brow services, I help clients achieve fuller, fluffier, perfectly shaped brows that last 6-8 weeks. Serving Highland Park, East Dallas, and surrounding areas with the latest brow beautification techniques.

### What is Brow Lamination?

**Brow lamination** (also called brow lift or brow perm) is a revolutionary treatment that transforms your natural brows by:

- **Lifting** each hair from the root for maximum fullness
- **Setting** brows in a uniform, upward direction
- **Creating** a fuller, fluffier "feathered" brow look
- **Taming** unruly or downward-growing hairs
- **Smoothing** gaps for a more complete appearance

Think of it as a "perm" for your brows—but instead of creating curls, it creates smooth, lifted, perfectly shaped brows.

### Benefits of Brow Lamination

#### Wake Up with Perfect Brows
- No daily brow makeup routine needed
- Instantly fuller appearance without filling in
- Low-maintenance beauty that saves time
- Perfect brows 24/7 for 6-8 weeks

#### Works for All Brow Types
- **Thin brows**: Creates illusion of fuller brows
- **Thick brows**: Tames and shapes unruly hairs
- **Sparse brows**: Maximizes the appearance of existing hairs
- **Uneven brows**: Creates symmetry and uniformity

### The Brow Lamination Process at Zey Brow & Wax

#### Step 1: Consultation & Design (5 minutes)
We discuss your desired brow shape and assess your natural brow pattern. I'll explain the process and answer any questions.

#### Step 2: Brow Shaping (10 minutes)
Before lamination, I shape your brows through threading or waxing to create the perfect foundation for your laminated brows.

#### Step 3: Lamination Application (30 minutes)
I apply professional lamination solutions to lift, set, and nourish your brows:
- **Lifting cream**: Softens hair structure
- **Setting solution**: Locks in the new shape
- **Nourishing treatment**: Conditions and protects

#### Step 4: Tinting (Optional)
Add brow tinting for even more definition and color depth.
